#  Holberton HBnB Project

Welcome to the **Holberton BnB (HBnB)** a full-stack web application project where we built everything from scratch, piece by piece. From database modeling to a fully interactive front-end, weâ€™ve done it all!



##  Project Overview

 HBnB is a clone of AirBnB (lite version) designed to help students learn how to build web applications from back-end to front-end. The project spans **4 main parts**, each focusing on a specific skillset and component of full-stack development.

## This project taught us how to:
- Structure a scalable API

- Handle authentication with JWT

- Manage user sessions via cookies

- Create dynamic user interfaces

- Debug frontend/backend interactions

We hope you enjoy exploring HBnB as much as we enjoyed building it! âœ¨

We Worked together to implement, test, and document each daigram together. Each member did contribute to it for the whole project.
In Part 4,  each student in the team created their own fork of the main repo to implement their individual version of the front-end. Collaboration was key, but independence gave us the freedom to learn!
